          <h3>About me and Languages</h3>
          <p>Originally from Scotland, I moved to Mainz in 2016. I started learning to code in 2020 and have learned a lot since then. I started with javascript and moved onto React, which is my primary language. <br> I’ve also learnt the basics of node and have created a fully functional API, connecting to a database, for my Flashcards project.  
            <p>
            Here are some of the languages I’ve learnt:
